Provides an implementation for finding periodic behavior and discovering unknown periods based on the paper of Ma and Hellerstein called "Mining Partially Periodic Event Patterns With Unknown Periods" (2001).

And from Borges et al. "Dynamically Periodic Event Patterns in Industrial Log Files" (The 3rd IEEE International Conference on Smart Data - 2017)
